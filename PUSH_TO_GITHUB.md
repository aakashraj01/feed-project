# Push to GitHub Instructions

## Step 1: Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `feed-project` (or any name you prefer)
3. Description: "A mini frontend application with authentication flow built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS"
4. Choose "Public" or "Private"
5. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push your code

After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/aakashraj/Downloads/Feed-Project

# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/aakashraj01/feed-project.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

You may be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials:
- Username: aakashraj01
- Password: Use a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

## To create a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Feed Project")
4. Select scopes: Check "repo" (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and use it as your password when pushing

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI
If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
gh repo create feed-project --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```
